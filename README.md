# Vanced Barrows!

Replaces the Barrows Brothers' face popup with JD Vance.

That is it.

## Configuration

The plugin now features a **Face Mode** dropdown menu in the settings panel, allowing you to choose what faces are displayed. Only one mode can be active at a time.

### Face Modes

*   **Barrows Faces:** This option restores the default in-game behavior, showing the original Barrows Brothers' faces in the tunnels.
*   **JD Vance Faces:** This is the classic Vanced Barrows experience, displaying random images of JD Vance.
*   **Custom Faces:** This mode allows you to use your own images.

### How to Use Custom Faces

1.  Select **Custom Faces** from the "Face Mode" dropdown in the plugin settings.
2.  Create a folder named `barrowsfaces` inside your `.runelite` directory.
    *   Your `.runelite` directory is usually located in your user folder (e.g., `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.runelite`).
    *   You can copy the exact path from the "Custom Faces Folder Path" field in the plugin's settings.
3.  Place your desired images (`.png` or `.jpg` files) into the `barrowsfaces` folder.

The plugin will now cycle through your custom images. If the folder is not found or contains no valid images, no overlay will be shown when this mode is active.


If anyone would like to add to the image rotation, hit me up.
Gotta use the image from the plugin as a base or your own and then give me permisson to use it, basically.

Big thanks to Justin (@its_OldBay) for the original idea/challenge!

Image credits for dripped out Vance also go to him!
